Day 19: More Problems

I had arrived late on this day but I did not miss much according to my teammates. We started with firing the laser pump again to see if we could gather any useful data from the SPCM. However, unfortunately the SPCM were not getting any substantial differences in the reading. Both our A and B receivers were reading very low counts at the range of 400 to 800 counts. This is very small when we compared it the data that the previous team have garnered during their research. The next step is to figure out why this is the case. 

The first thing tried out was moving the B up and down vertically along the ruler taped next to it. We were testing to see if the reason why we weren't getting any good readings for our experiment. During this troubleshooting session, sliding the A and B vertical along the ruler made little to no improvement.

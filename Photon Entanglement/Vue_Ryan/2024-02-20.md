Day 5:
Goals:

- Trying to get the FPGA to register USB Blaster
- Got Demo code from the CD in the Lab room
- Try figuring anything out from external links
	We were given some external links to look and read via Dr. Zimmerman. While Ulrik and Seth did their respective on the figuring out anything out with code, I looked into the links that were provided. I read over them and looked out else, but I really got that was helpful was more so for understanding the lab or the set-up the laser-pump and component for it. Nothing really useful for the issues that we were encountering.

Day 15 Summary:
**Working with Voltage Divider**
Last week we made the discovery when plugging the voltage divider, it did not respond with correlated pins that we stated for the FPGA. Seth said that was also a problem that he encountered the last he had worked on this project. His group had used something that is called the function generator at Fruklund Hall. So with Dr. Zimmerman permission, we headed over to test the pins of the FPGA. It takes some time to get to work due to the labs not being open yet when we got there, so we needed to wait while one of the staff

- Figure out of FPGA is working or not
	- Reason being none of the lights are on for the FPGA
	We noticed that every time we plugged in the FPGA the lights would not turn on. This is an issue because this is a tell tale sign that FPGA is not working as intended.
- Plan to verify code by test demo code
	The plan was to see if the demo code that Quartus Prime has works in just strict terms of running code. 
- Was able to verify the demo code was working on the Linux PC
	Ulrik was able to run the demo code on the Linux PC clarifying that is not the code that is the problem but perhaps something that has to do with the setting with FPGA.
- Trying to figure out what or why the USB Blaster is not working despite the code running seemingly fine.
	From what we gathered over the numerous test runs that the team has done, the main issue resides within the Quartus Prime program or FPGA itself.
- Towards the end of the class period we figured out that the FPGA works when use Quartus Prime if the hardware setup is not changed and left on the default setup that it starts up with.
	Seth made a discovery that the FPGA does work with the USB Blaster. Apparently, when starting up the Quartus Prime, it needed to be in the default setup port and not anywhere else. We decided not to pursue the logic behind any further since it was time to close-up shop.

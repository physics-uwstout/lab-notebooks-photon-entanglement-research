- Today was a introduction to the proejct
- I basically just explained the basics of the physics to Ulrik and Ryan who will be my group mates for the remainder of the semester.
- Ulrik is a fellow 439 student but Ryan is a 139 Student so i had to make sure to explain things in terms he could understand since he does not have any experience with Quantum Mechanics or Optics
- Once things were explained we began taking apart the experiment from last time and decided we would rerun everything that has been done

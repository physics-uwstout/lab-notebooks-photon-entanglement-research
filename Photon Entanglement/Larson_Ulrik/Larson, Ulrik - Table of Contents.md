This is an example of the folder and file structure for your lab notebook.  Organize your subfolders the same way you see here.


Some notable entries are listed, which contain important information:
- [[Larson, Ulrik - Apr. 4, 2024]] -- Information for **getting code onto the FPGA** (assumes Quartus Prime is installed on Linux)
- [[Larson, Ulrik - Feb. 22, 2024]] -- Prior to this point, much information about the devices available to us may be inaccurate.

Some inaccurate information is listed in the earlier entries. Among these false claims:
- The FPGA we are using is a Cyclone IV device. It is NOT a Cyclone II device.

All entries are listed below, in chronological order of file creation:

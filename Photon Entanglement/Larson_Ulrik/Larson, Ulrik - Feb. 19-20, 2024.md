Reminder for Next Time: ~~**Ask Dr. Zimmerman if a CD came packaged with the Cyclone II device. It has some software downloads we'll need.**~~


Addendum: Feb. 20, 2024:
~~No action needed; we have the required CD already.~~ *Addendum from 3/7/2024: We do not possess a physical copy of the required CD, but downloaded one from Terasic at https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=139&No=502&PartNo=4
One of the CD downloads there is required to get demo code, but I don't remember which one.*

We have properly identified our device this time. However, the USB blaster still is not recognized -- it is an inert cord. Even with the device on the other end powered on, it does not register to our computers as anything.

(Note: A large amount of text was removed from this entry as it assumed we were using a Cyclone II device. This is not correct; we are using a Cyclone IV device.)

We require a device capable of the following:
* Detecting 2.2V pulses that last 10ns
* Keeping time accurately enough to verify whether two different events happened at the exact same time (~10ns precision)
* Sending live data back to a computer
It doesn't matter how that device sends it back to a computer. Serial connection, USB connection, whatever -- as long as it can be harvested and processed with Python, we're golden.

Regardless of whether the rest of the team gets the FPGA working, by now Dr. Zimmerman and/or Dr. Patterson should be back. Ask one of them about nabbing an oscilloscope.

Ryan's back today.

End-of-day summary:
* Our FPGA seems to be perfectly functional. It's simply uncooperative.
* Do NOT eat straight garlic cloves. The pain is gone now, but I ate a couple yesterday and my mouth still hasn't totally forgotten.
* Dr. Patterson might have a couple oscilloscopes lying around I could ask for. Maybe one of those will work?

Little Task for Today: This is the last chance I'm giving our team to get that FPGA working. Otherwise, I'm nabbing an oscilloscope.

...

It would appear our FPGA is functional and can run the demonstration code if it is in RUN mode and not PROGRAM mode, but without knowing how to use active serial programming to get code onto the FPGA we're still stuck. (The demonstration code we got working used JTAG programming, and is lost when the FPGA loses power, such as may happen when it is turned off.)

Our Quartus code might be bad -- which is going to be a problem, because none of us know how to write code for FPGAs, and while the manufacturers here still keep everything they own proprietary and no open-source alternatives exist it is probably going to stay that way.
We don't know how to write FPGA code. We don't know how to learn to write FPGA code.
This FPGA still isn't doing us any good.

I think I might still grab an oscilloscope after break.

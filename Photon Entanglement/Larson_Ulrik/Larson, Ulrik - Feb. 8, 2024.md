Take a look at "liquid cat". It's a piece of two-minute artwork I created to test whether Obsidian can take images.

Its actual scholarly, intellectual, or academic value is of doubt, but I'm glad Obsidian has image display capability. Unsurprisingly, Obsidian can't actually *interact* with the image in any way, since it's a coked-out text editor and not a super-software tailored to the whims of Herr Ulrik Larson himself.

In other news, I've gained access to the relevant lab notebooks -- with some assistance, of course. I was never going to figure out on my own that I'd have to copy and paste some links into an incognito window to bypass security clearance. (Seriously, what the hell? Why does that work? *How does a signed in user have fewer privileges than a complete stranger!?*)

In any case, Seth scavenged this beautiful piece of artifice from his previous notebook on this topic, supplied here in link form and supplied in the Misc Files folder in .zip form for your pleasure, convenience and edification.
[[Single Photon.zip]]
It's a .zip file, filled with goodies, like a bag of Halloween candy collected from an affluent neighborhood.

Oh, looks like it wasn't created by Stout.
~~The read me file is extremely long, and is a pdf. I'd suggest giving it a quick read (or telling someone else to do so for you!) when you have two or three hours to blow.~~ Seth's notebook notes that most of the "read me" files are useless. (That said, they never got their project working, so what could they possibly know? ...The answer I'm looking for is "more than me.")

Named as a diamond gem in a sea of mud is the INSTRUCTIONS.pdf in the PythonCode folder. It describes the use of the command terminal to run files, and then describes the role of each python file. I skimmed it. Not an entertaining read.
Not useful.
Yet.
*There's a reason we're using something other than a Stout laptop to interface with the equipment. It's not clear to me yet what code is to be run on the laptop, and what code is to be run on the DE2-115 thingy.
I imagine that Quartus II thing is required? It's a program designed to work with the FPGA side of things.*

I found Quartus II, I think.

I think this will work, even though Intel seems to provide this software free of charge, on the condition they had no hand in any damages resulting in the use of their obviously outmoded software.

Are you tired of "quartus no work"-itis?
Is your USB blaster registering as a "Variant" device and not doing its job?
Fear not; with this simple trick I made for you, all that can be fixed!
Just open Quartus, open the default demo project, and go to programmer mode.

Then, open the terminal:

su root
	[You'll need to invoke the magical temporaryROOT]
cd Desktop
	[Navigates to the proper directory; this might be different for you.]
./ulrik-quartus-fixer.sh

And then you're golden! Quartus will figure out the rest if everything worked correctly.
Open programmer mode (if you haven't already), go to hardware setup, and select your
device as usual. If nothing shows up, close the hardware setup and open it again.
(Also make sure the FPGA is plugged in and in RUN mode.)
If USB Blaster shows up but it isn't a variant device, you're good to go!
If USB Blaster Variant shows up, you either didn't use it right or you're screwed.

Much of our progress was stop and start. We backtracked much.
There is value to this. It is important to learn resilience.

But, in the event that our goal in this course is not to experience what I have experienced, but rather to collect data, there is something I feel we had really ought to do.
We (meaning Ryan, Seth, and myself) have gotten a lot of troubleshooting done.
Trial and error is pitifully slow.
We should test our solutions, ensure they work, and write them down very, very precisely.
In a step-by-step fashion, rather than a "this worked, this didn't, this is what we'll try next".
While valuable -- and I do not propose replacing our lab notebooks with a user manual -- these have their limits.

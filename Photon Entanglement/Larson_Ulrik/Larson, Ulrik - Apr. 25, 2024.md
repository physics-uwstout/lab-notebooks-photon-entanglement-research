So. This is how it ends.
I've concluded that, if downconversion is taking place, we do not have the techniques and patience required to verify it.
We thought we'd found it.
We did not find it.

(Note that the data is overlayed by a dimmed and mirrored copy of itself, to reference against!)

This is consistent with having the following features:
1. A beam blocker which eclipses the light of the blue laser in its highest intensity region (the sharp well, with a box notated above it)
2. At ~3 degrees, a spike in light intensity was registered.
3. At ~-3 degrees, no spike was registered.
If it were down-converted light we were finding, we would find a corresponding spike on the opposite side. That would be expected since down-conversion obeys momentum conservation.
We haven't really totally checked if the photodiode can receive this light; we think it can.
We do not know.
And we really should've used a band-pass filter on it, in hindsight...

...But in essence, we have found garbage light.
I don't know why the heck the irises in our setup aren't cleaning up all the weird nonsense our laser is putting out. Maybe it's some weird reflections off some imperfections or dust. I don't know.

In previous days, we've been getting photon counts from one side, but not the other, but they were lower than we'd expected.
I think we figured out why.
It's just blue light. A small amount of it makes it through the band pass filter because nothing is perfect.

To be honest, I'm a tad miffed to find, on the second to last day of class, that we were much further away from our goals than we'd originally believed.

The equipment at our disposal is intended to recreate a Nobel prize-winning experiment which demonstrated a few fundamental properties of photons.

I have access to the notebooks I had accessed when I was taking the non-advanced version of this course in the spring of 2022 (PHYS-149, I believe?), but I do not have access to any notebooks that aren't either:
1. Mine
2. A former labmate's
This holds true for the lab notebooks from 2018, 2020, and 2022.
As entertaining as my previous notebook from 2022 ought to be, it is not currently relevant to my concerns.

I'm sure this will get figured out at some point.

We spent some time dismantling the previous apparatus. Its parts are likely all functional -- not that I checked myself -- but the whole was never convinced to work as intended.

I actually don't know why I was told to disassemble it. They seemed unsure of the decision for a while as well.

The different parts are as follows, most of which are either bolts, a boltboard, or possible to bolt to the boltboard:
- A big ol' board with threaded holes marked Thorlabs
- A bunch of bolts, compatible with the board; some short, some long, some in between
- Some mirrors, marked Thorlabs
- A Thorlabs laser
- Three very delicate Thorlabs sensors, capable of detecting individual photons. These are supposedly around ten thousand dollars each, so they might've actually cost someone an arm, a leg, or a pact with the devil to procure.
- A down-conversion crystal, marked BBO Crystal (for beta-barium borate) and marked Thorlabs
- A very light and delicate cobweb, used to hold the laser in place, and no doubt manufactured by Thorlabs. (I wonder how much it was marked up by? I sort of destroyed it with a ruler.)
- A bunch of other components I haven't taken the time to identify, manufactured by Thorlabs
- Some kind of Thorlabs clamp, which holds a cube. ...I'm pretty sure the cube has a half-silvered mirror in it that splits light.
- An advanced-looking computer (which isn't marked Thorlabs, actually) that can supposedly handle data streams with nanosecond resolution and precision, like what we'll be working with. Considering the speed of light is about 30cm/ns and electricity is much slower, the size of the computer clues me in that the calculations themselves will not be quite so instantaneous.

I think this place could use some dusting and cleaning, considering the local wildlife made its way in here while nobody was looking.

...

The life of a spider is short and far less rich than my own life, considering their ambush predation strategy - much of it is spent simply waiting. I wonder how much of it was spent confused, in a perfectly dark room, without the variations of night and day?

It's probably dead by now. I just hope it didn't decide our laser would make a nice coffin.

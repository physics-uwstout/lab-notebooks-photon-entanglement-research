Day 22:
Today we decided to mess around with the photo and the photo dump. Giving our previous findings, tinkering with the idlers and receivers did not  seem to do much. So we decided to do some test runs with the photo diode to gather some data to potentially use. We turned off the lights in room and move the sensor for the photo diode over a range of 2.5 inches in the negatives and the positives. The data we gather from this test did help shed light on the fact that one side was definitely not getting a beam.  We decided to do another test run with some more points and and some additional control elements. We did same test run but instead of going every half of a inch to 2.5, we went to 5 inches. The control element we decided to add in was turning the photo diode around so the light of the device to interfere with the sensor we were using. We able to gather some more data, but there was both good and bad news. The good news is that was side able to follow the trend  To be specific, this show that even though one of the receivers was not working as intended, it did work to an extent. However, we still could not figure why this was the case. If the photo diode was not working, that clearly meant that something was wrong with the receiver or how it was receiving the laser from the laser pump.

We decided to mess with the orientation of the BBO conversion crystal and how close the photon dump was. So

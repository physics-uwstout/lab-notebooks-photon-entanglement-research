- Figure out of FPGA is working or not
	- Reason being none of the lights are on for the FPGA
- Plan to verify code by test demo code
- Was able to verify the demo code was working on the Linux PC 
- Trying to figure out what or why the USB Blaster is not working despite the code running seemingly fine.
- Towards the end of the class period we figured out that the FPGA works when use Quartus Prime if the hardware setup is not changed and left on the default setup that it starts up with.
- After reading the a document sent by Dr. Zimmerman, I got a better understand of how to set-up the first lab. Most of the basic components have been set-up, so I just had to clean up the working space to get a better view and see what is necessary.

Day 17:
Miscounting leads to disaster:
I had solder our final pin wire 30 to a ground in the voltage. However, when it came to testing the voltage divider with the FPGA, the voltage divider box started smoking. Lucky, Seth was able to catch it right away and unplug the voltage divider box. We opened the box to see how damage was done, and it was pretty bad. Our wires at 12 and supposed 30 was burnt up to a crisp. (Insert picture).We began to ponder why this had occurred. After doing some reviewing, we couldn't figure out the problem with wires. 



In order to get some answers, we went to talk to Dr. Zimmerman about the whole situation. Dr. Zimmerman had come over to our lab station to see if he could figure out what happened. Dr. Zimmerman had looked at the pin chart that we were using to wire to corresponding pins. Dr. Zimmerman had pointed out that it is possible was short circuit in which we remove one of the grounds that we had soldered or it was possible that we had actually ended up soldering the 3.3 volts wire which is the 29th wire and that was cause the damage. Seth did a recount and it appeared that we had indeed soldered the 3.3 volts instead a ground wire. Seth was able to rewire 30 to proper ground of B'. Seth also noticed that the resistor for A was broken so we had to replaced that on as well. (Insert picture). After that was all done, we test the voltage divider just make sure it wouldn't short circuit which it didn't. So we carried on we the experiment, and we able to get data for A',B,B' but not for A. So we opened the box, and noticed that the wire for the A counter was unattached. It was cause during the short circuit. We rewired the A to corresponding wire. Then we ran the test again, and A was getting data. We that we concluded that everything was in working order. 

The next step we did was clear-up the laser set-up. Since the wires were everywhere on lab set-up, we move things around and started labeling everything that we would know where everything was.

Day 3: Doing what we can
- I was out sick this day unfortunately could not help out at the lab. However, I will still document what my teammates did during my absence. 
- Ulrik had gotten Quartus Prime installed was able to run the program. However, from I have seen and been told, Quartus Prime has not been exactly functioning the way we would want. 
- Seth has been using the command prompt to verify and confirm any issues with the code. Which there has been a few setbacks in the step. The code is operatable, it just has some issues that we can't quite work out yet.

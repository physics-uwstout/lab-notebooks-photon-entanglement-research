# === CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE ===
#
# To adapt this rubric:
# 1. Update assignment name and total points
# 2. Adjust criterion weights to match your priorities
# 3. Modify descriptions to match your assignment type
# 4. Update keywords to match your domain (e.g., circuit→algorithm, experiment→simulation)
# 5. Update common_issues based on what you see in student work
# 6. Add/remove criteria as needed (keep 4-8 criteria for best results)
#
# Examples:
# - Programming assignment: Add "code_quality" criterion
# - Design project: Add "design_judgements" criterion
# - Report-only: Remove "execution" criterion

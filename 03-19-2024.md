- Group has decided to effectively split into separate task to efficiently set-up the single proton entanglement Lab 1
- Seth and Ulrik are working on the code aspect of the experiment. This includes working out the fine details like seeing where the code has errors and trying to figure out what or why some of the code is running into issues. 
- I am working on setting the lab experiment components up properly for the time being. Trying to recreate the set-up from the pictures is a lot more challenging than I. Not really not which piece to put where is a little confusing.
- So, I eventually asked Dr. Zimmerman if he could send us any retaining information on how to set-up the first lab in this long-series of multiple labs.

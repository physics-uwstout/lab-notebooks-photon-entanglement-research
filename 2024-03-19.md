-Objectives: Getting Code to Work with FPGA and Setting Lab
- Group has decided to effectively split into separate task to efficiently set-up the single proton entanglement Lab 1
- Seth and Ulrik are working on the code aspect of the experiment. This includes working out the fine details like seeing where the code has errors and trying to figure out what or why some of the code is running into issues. 

- I am working on setting the lab experiment components up properly for the time being. Trying to recreate the set-up from the pictures is a lot more challenging than I. Not really not which piece to put where is a little confusing.

- So, I eventually asked Dr. Zimmerman if he could send us any retaining information on how to set-up the first lab in this long-series of multiple labs. After reading the a document sent by Dr. Zimmerman, I got a better understand of how to set-up the first lab. Most of the basic components have been set-up, so I just had to clean up the working space to get a better view and see what is necessary

-  The first lab is seems to be very simple. It is just setting up the laser pump, a beam splitter, a down converter, idler and signal, and beam collector/reader (not the actual term but one I am using since that its main purpose). I just to double check with the crew just to make sure things are done properly.

- I took another look at the experiment set-up and it has is really messing open component that we may or may not need. I believe it was something along the lines of a beam aligner or something of the sort. Its importance I am not yet sure of but I will when the experiment is ready to be conducted.

- However, at the very last moments of our time working together, Ulrik was able to get the Linux PC to work with the FPGA.

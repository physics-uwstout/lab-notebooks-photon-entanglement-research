Day 21: Wire Work and Len Adjustment

**Trouble Shooting the lens**
Today, we decide that we were going to work on see if we could improve the performance we were receiving from our set-up. So first thing that we had done was touch up on the lens or laser alignment of the laser. Seth and Ulrik had explained to me what the plan for the troubleshooting process. According to a video that they had watched prior, it was possible to align the laser with lens using a piece of paper and a hole. How this works is when we align the hole on the piece of paper with the lens (in this case the half-way plate) until we see the a reflection of the laser on the piece of paper. There will be two reflection of the laser on the paper if this is done correctly. The two laser reflection may be in different spots. The objective is to get these two laser reflection on top of each other because the means that reflections have been aligned each other. That is what we want to achieve. You may have to move the lens back and forth or make it go up and down to properly align the laser reflections.

**Trying New Wires**
After we align laser as best we can, we decided to do a test run to see if we could gather any useful data for SPCM. Unfortunately, the same results as before, which is bad because the counts we got before when very low counts. So we decided that would try something else. We decided that we would change the fiber optics to see if our fiber optics were faulty. So we grabbed some optic fiber wire from the lab next door and plugged in those. We ran some more test runs with new optic fiber wire but sadly it was the same results. We did get some high counts but there had ignored due to the fact that they were spikes cause by the green light we use to see in the dark.

**Trying Different SPCM**
So the next step we took was to try and see if was a problem with SPCM. The team knew that was a bit of a long shot due to the fact that SPCMs were working as intended. However, with so little options left, we decided to try it anyways on the  off chance that it was the SPCM not functioning properly. So we replace the SPCMs that we were using with some others that we had in the lab. After that, we ran some test runs with the replaced SPCMs to see if we would get any different counts. We did not get any new data and was pretty the same results with A being very little counts and B being the only one some reasonable counts.

**New Approaches**
The team decided that we would place the SPCMs into a box since the green light did affect the readings of the SPCMs if the green light was shown near the SPCMs. So quickly we made makeshift home the SPCMs in box to block out any light. Hopefully, we get different results our next test run.
